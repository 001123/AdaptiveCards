# Actions - WinUI 3

Any **actions** within the card will render as WinUI 3 **Button**'s, but it's up to your app to handle what happens when a user presses them (except for ShowCard actions... see code snippet for more info).

The `RenderedAdaptiveCard` object provides an `Action` event for this purpose.

```csharp
// Render a card (as previously shown)
RenderedAdaptiveCard renderedAdaptiveCard =  renderer.RenderAdaptiveCard(card);

// ...

// Attach the event handler for action click events
renderedAdaptiveCard.Action += RenderedAdaptiveCard_Action;

private async void RenderedAdaptiveCard_Action(RenderedAdaptiveCard sender, AdaptiveActionEventArgs args)
{
    if (args.Action is AdaptiveOpenUrlAction openUrlAction)
    {
        await Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(openUrlAction.Url);
    }

    else if (args.Action is AdaptiveShowCardAction showCardAction)
    {
        // This is only fired if, in HostConfig, you set the ShowCard ActionMode to Popup.
        // Otherwise, the renderer will automatically display the card inline without firing this event.
    }

    else if (args.Action is AdaptiveSubmitAction submitAction)
    {
        // Get the data and inputs
        string data = submitAction.DataJson.Stringify();
        string inputs = args.Inputs.AsJson().Stringify();

        // Process them as desired
    }
}
```
