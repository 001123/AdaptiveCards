# Getting started - Xamarin.Android

This is a renderer library which targets native xamarin android applications and is based on the Android renderer that you can find [here](link to android page).

The [Xamarin.Android Visualizer sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/AdaptiveCards/tree/master/source/xamarin/Xamarin.Droid.Sample) lets you visualize cards using Xamarin.Android. If you have ever used the Android sample application you'll find the experience to be really similar.

## Next steps

For a quick start check [Render a card](render-a-card.md) for the next steps!

For a more in depth view of the classes that have been binded for the Xamarin.Android renderer library, you can check them [here](class-index.md)!
