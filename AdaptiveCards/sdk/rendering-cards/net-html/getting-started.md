# Getting started - .NET HTML

As we described in [Getting Started](../../../authoring-cards/getting-started.md) page, an Adaptive Card is a JSON-serialized card object model. This is a .NET library for generating HTML markup, typically from a server.

## NuGet install

[![Nuget install](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Html.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Html)

```console
Install-Package AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Html -IncludePrerelease
```

## Next steps

See [Render a card](render-a-card.md) for the next steps!
